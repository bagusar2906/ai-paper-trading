"""
mt5_signal_server.py

Runs your existing EMARSIADXStrategy against live MT5 data and broadcasts
BUY/SELL signals over WebSocket to connected clients - primarily the
SignalDisplayEA.mq5 Expert Advisor, which draws them as arrows on the MT5
chart.

This does NOT place any orders. It only generates and broadcasts signals.

Run from your paper-trading project root (same folder as app/):

    python mt5_signal_server.py

Requires: pip install websockets
